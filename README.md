# Cervical-Cancer-Screening-Project
A mobile health (mHealth) project designed to increase cervical cancer screening uptake in Laikipia County, Kenya, by using AI-driven risk assessment, educational tools, and automated follow-ups. The goal is to support early detection and reduce preventable mortality among women.

## Project Overview 
Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in Laikipia County. Despite free screening services, uptake remains critically low at 19% in 2023, far below the WHO target of 70%. SCREEN-IT addresses barriers such as limited awareness, poor access, and follow-up gaps by developing a user-friendly mobile app powered by AI and supported by community health promoters (CHPs).

## Problem Statement
Low cervical cancer screening uptake is the primary driver of high morbidity and mortality in Laikipia. Women, especially in remote and underserved areas, face barriers including lack of knowledge, cultural discomfort, and logistical challenges. Without targeted interventions, these trends will persist, leaving many women at risk of late diagnosis and poor outcomes.

### Who is Affected
- Women of reproductive and middle age in Laikipia County
- Community Health Promoters (CHPs)
- Local healthcare providers and public health systems

### Evidence of the Problem
- Cervical cancer is the **second most common cancer among women in Kenya**.
- It accounts for **15% of cancer-related deaths in Laikipia County**.
- National screening coverage was only **16.81% in 2022**, with Laikipia slightly higher at **19% in 2023**.
- Key barriers include limited facility access, poor awareness, fear of screening procedures, and cultural discomfort.

## Project Objectives

- Increase cervical cancer screening uptake in Laikipia County by deploying an AI-powered mHealth solution.
- Develop and implement a mobile app that supports CHPs with risk assessment, referrals, reminders, and educational content.
- Leverage AI-driven risk stratification to prioritize high-risk individuals for early screening and follow-up.
- Improve community awareness and knowledge about cervical cancer prevention.
- Collect and analyze real-time data to monitor screening trends and adherence.
- Evaluate effectiveness and generate recommendations for scale-up.

### Desired Outcomes

- Significant increase in screening rates, approaching the WHO target of 70%.
- Earlier detection and intervention for high-risk individuals, reducing mortality.
- Enhanced efficiency and engagement of CHPs via digital tools.
- Improved health literacy among women in Laikipia.
- Data-driven insights to inform public health policies and expansion plans.
